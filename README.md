### Description
Hexlet chat is a simplified version of slack, where you can exchange messages in real time, add, rename and delete channels, since the project uses web sockets.

The project is based on React and Redux Toolkit. REST API is used, authorization and user authentication.

Obscene words and expressions are filtered, information about errors encountered by users is collected, and transferred to the error collector for their quick elimination.
